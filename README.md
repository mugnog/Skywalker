## 🧠 The Skywalker Philosophy
Skywalker isn't just a tracker; it's a training system based on the latest sports science:
* **Pyramidal Training Model:** Focus on the 70/20/10 distribution (Seiler). Nevertheless, you can decide which trainigs from you prefer.
* **Physiological Optimization:** Targeted FTP increase and VLamax reduction (Mader/Coggan).
* **Health-First Coaching:** Adjusts intensity based on Sleep Score, HRV, and subjective Stress levels.

* **Performance Matrix:** CTL (Fitness), ATL (Fatigue), and TSB (Form) tracking.
* **AI Coach "Skywalker":** Chat with an AI agent that knows your history and current recovery state.

* **Wahoo & Zwift Integration:** Supports Virtual Rides (Zwift) and Outdoor sessions (Garmin/Wahoo/Coros and more) with smart cadence/power detection.
